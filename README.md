1. **Objective**: Develop a covert QR code generator that the driving range system accepts, ___unlocking free golf balls for life___!
2. **Codename**: InfinitiSphere.
3. **Operation Name**: Operation Tee Time.
3. **Agent**: Max Seelig.
5. **Equipment**:
    - **Laptop with VSCode and CoPilot**: Essential for covert programming.
    - **Burner Phone**: For flooding the system with generated QR codes.
    - **Secret Programming Language**: JavaScript, the language of spies.
    - **Coffee**: Vital for late-night coding sessions.
6. **Infiltration and Deployment**:
    - **Step 1**: Infiltrate the driving range premises.
    - **Step 2**: Analyze existing QR codes.
    - **Step 3**: Decipher the QR code algorithm.
    - **Step 4**: Construct a specialized QR code generator compatible with the system.
7. **Execution**:
    - **Timing**: Blend in with the golfers. Maintain a low profile. Avoid suspicion at all costs.
    - **Location**: Concealed in the bushes near the driving range.
    - **Action**: Generate a QR code that the driving range system recognizes, granting access to free golf balls.
    - **Note**: Hide laptop, hold a golf club in stead. Stay in character.
9. **Exfiltration**:
    - **Timing**: When your hands are bleeding from hitting too many golf balls.
    - **Location**: Exit through the main gate, blending in with the crowd.

## Quick Start
Clone or download [this repo](https://github.com/m-a-x-s-e-e-l-i-g/project-infinitisphere), then install the dependencies and run the dev server:

```
npx degit https://github.com/m-a-x-s-e-e-l-i-g/project-infinitisphere project-infinitisphere
cd project-infinitisphere
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

That should get a dev server up and running (assuming you have npm and Node installed already). Any saved changes to components and styles should auto-refresh blazingly fast.
